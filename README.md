# Train-Valid-Test-Split Dataset
## Definition of Train-Valid-Test 
Split Train-Valid-Test split is a technique to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model â€” classification or regression alike.  We need to take a given dataset and divide it into three subsets.  A brief description of the role of each of these datasets is below. 
## Train Dataset 
Set of data used for learning (by the model), that is, to fit the parameters to the machine learning model.
## Valid Dataset 
Set of data used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a model fitted on the training dataset while tuning model hyperparameters. 
Also play a role in other forms of model preparation, such as feature selection, and threshold cut-off selection. 
## Test Dataset 
*Set of data used* to provide an unbiased evaluation of a final model fitted on the training dataset.
